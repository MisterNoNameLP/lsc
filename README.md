LSC (LaunchScriptCollector) is a Lua/[PleaL](https://github.com/MisterNoNameLP/PleaL) script collecting all .exe and .sh files from given directories putting launch scirpt for these files into a single directory.

It is supposed to have launch scripts for all games from multiple sources (GOG, itch.io ...) in one location.

This script is createt for personal use, so there is not much polishing or further instruction. For questions please open a issue.
